{c:G harmonic 12th}


Rollin' down-a [G]backwoods, Tennessee by[D] way
[Em]One arm on the [C/G]wheel
Holdin' my [G]lover, with the [D]other
[Em]A sweet, soft Southern [C/G]thrill
Worked hard all [Em]week, Got a little [D]jingle
On a [Em]Tennessee Saturday [C/G]night
Couldn't feel [G]better, I'm to[D]gether
With my [Cm]Dixieland Delight[G]

{c:Chorus}
{soc}
    Spend my [D]dollar
    Parked in a [Em] holler 'neath the mountain moon[C]light
    Hold her [G]up tight, Make a little [D]lovin'
    A little turtle[Em]dovin' on a Mason-Dixon [C/G]night
    Fits my [Em]life, Oh, so [C/G]right
    My [Cm]Dixieland De[G]light

White-tail [G]buck deer, munching on cl[D]over
[Em]Red-tail hawk, sitting on a limb
Chubby old [G]groundhog, Croaking b[D]ullfrog
[Em]Free as a feeling in the [C/G]wind
Homegrown [Em]country girl gonna give m[D]e a whirl
On a [Em]Tennessee Saturday [C/G]night
Lucky as a [G]seven, Livin' in [D]heaven
With my [Cm]Dixieland D[G]elight
